# Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Project Summary

## Overview

This project involved creating a comprehensive set of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) for the CitiMed medical system. The diagrams provide a visual representation of how data flows through the system, the processes that transform the data, the external entities that interact with the system, and the data stores where information is kept.

## Completed Deliverables

1. **DFD Analysis Document** (`dfd_analysis.md`)
   - Identified external entities (actors)
   - Documented main processes
   - Listed data stores
   - Described key data flows

2. **Context-Level (Level 0) DFD** (`dfd_level0.md`)
   - Shows the CitiMed system as a single process
   - Illustrates interactions with external entities (Staff, Patients, Payment Systems)
   - Displays high-level data flows in and out of the system

3. **Level 1 DFD** (`dfd_level1.md`)
   - Breaks down the system into five main processes:
     - Authentication & Authorization
     - Patient Management
     - Visit Management
     - Financial Management
     - Reporting & Analytics
   - Shows interactions between processes, data stores, and external entities
   - Illustrates the main data flows within the system

4. **Level 2 DFD for Visit Management** (`dfd_level2_visit_management.md`)
   - Provides a detailed breakdown of the Visit Management process
   - Shows five subprocesses:
     - Patient Search & Selection
     - Medical Information Entry
     - Visit Creation & Storage
     - Financial Information Processing
     - Visit Confirmation & Summary
   - Illustrates detailed data flows between subprocesses and data stores

5. **README with Implementation Instructions** (`README_DFD.md`)
   - Provides an overview of the DFD files
   - Includes instructions for converting ASCII diagrams to professional diagrams
   - Lists tools that can be used (Draw.io, Lucidchart, Mermaid)
   - Explains standard DFD symbols
   - Outlines next steps for implementation

## System Understanding

Through the process of creating these DFDs, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the CitiMed system:

- It's a medical management system with role-based access control
- It manages patients, visits, and financial transactions
- It has a complex visit creation process that includes medical and financial components
- It supports various payment methods and balance tracking
- It has reporting capabilities for data analysis

## Next Steps

1. Convert the ASCII diagrams to professional diagrams using tools like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid
2. Incorporate the diagrams into the project documentation
3. Use the diagrams for:
   - Onboarding new team members
   - Planning system enhancements
   - Identifying potential bottlenecks or security concerns
   - Communicating system architecture to stakeholders
