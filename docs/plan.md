   - Add proper exception handling

### Phase 2: Refactoring and Optimization

The second phase involves more substantial changes to improve the codebase structure and performance.

1. Refactor complex methods
   - Break down the createVisit method into smaller, more focused methods

## Testing Strategy

For each improvement:

1. Write or update unit tests to cover the changes
2. Perform manual testing to ensure functionality works as expected
3. Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to style guidelines

## Deployment Strategy

1. Deploy bug fixes and code quality improvements first
2. Deploy refactoring and optimization changes after thorough testing
3. Deploy new features incrementally, with user feedback incorporated between releases

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in reported bugs
- Improved code maintainability (measured by static analysis tools)
- Faster page load and response times
- Positive user feedback on new features
